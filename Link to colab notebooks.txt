There are four sections to this notebook.

1. Workspace
- This contains all of the code used to produce the results found in the project dissertation.

2. myRL Package Example
- This contains the example code which demonstrates the use of the myRL package.

3. DDPG, TD3, SAC code templates
- This contains the basic code templates used for each test (without the clutter of each test that is found in the workspace)

4. Code Documentation.ipynb
- This notebook contains a near line-by-line breakdown of the code used for the DDPG algorithm. This was produced when trying to understand 
the code from Udemy (which the DDPG, TD3, and SAC algorithms are implemented from). This was only produced for DDPG as TD3 and SAC use the
same fundamental structure as DDPG.
